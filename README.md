## Udacity Project Responses
**Name**: Chris Aasted

**How long it took to complete the project**: 8 hours to place assets and write scripts, but then another 8 hours of baking, testing, and adjusting settings for performance.

**One thing you liked**: Writing the scripts for the object interactions was the most enjoyable part of this project.

**One thing that was challenging**: Until I lowered the baked resolution significantly, the ambient occlusion part of the bake process actually blue-screened my computer a couple times.
